# Connecting and interacting with databases

## Lesson overview

1. In working with a database, we'll need to use a **Database Management System (DBMS)**. There are many different systems out there, but the particular DBMS we'll be using is called [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or simply **Postgres**).

2. In this lesson, we'll go over the basics of **DBAPIs**, and how they are used to interact with a database from another language (like Python).

3. Then finally, we'll get some experience working specifically with the widely used [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/) library, which will allow us to interact with a database from Python.

## Relational databases

* **Persistance** (allowing access later, after it was created)
* **Shared source of truth** accessible by many users
* **Ability to store many data types of data** (efficiently)
* **Concurrency control** (handling multiple db actions at once)

### Primary Keys & Foreign Keys

Primary Keys
* The primary key is the unique identifier for the entire row, referring to 1 or more columns.
* If there are more than 1 columns for the primary key, then the set of primary key columns is known as a composite key.

Foreign Keys
* Maps the primary key from another (foreign) table, within a given table.
* Encodes relationships from one table to another.

### SQL

>#### SQL Practice Exercises
>Go to [this SQLFiddle of drivers and vehicles](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/a114f/2), and try practicing SQL using the exercises below.

>Manipulating & Querying Data
>* Insert a few records into both drivers and vehicles. Include 3 records of drivers who have vehicles, belonging in >the vehicles table.
>* Select all driver records; select all vehicle records; select only 3 vehicle records (using LIMIT)
>* Driver with ID 2 no longer owns any vehicles. Update the database to reflect this.
>* Driver with ID 1 now owns a new vehicle in addition to the previous one they owned. Update the database to reflect this.
>
>Joins & Group Bys
>* Select all vehicles owned by driver with ID 3.
>* Select all vehicles owned by driver with name 'Sarah' (without knowing their ID).
>* Show a table of the number of vehicles owned per driver.
>* Show the number of drivers that own a Nissan model.
>
>Structuring Data
>* Add information about vehicle color.
>* Update all existing vehicle records to have a vehicle color.
>* Add contact information (email, address) to the drivers table.
>
>Challenges
>Using Timestamps [(see help here)](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-timestamp/),
>
>* Update vehicles table to show date of registration information
>* The DMV is looking to notify all drivers with a vehicle that needs their registration renewed in the next month. If vehicles need to renew their vehicles once every year after their date of registration, then write a query to fetch all drivers with at least 1 vehicle that has an upcoming renewal in the next month, fetching their contact information as well as information about which vehicles need renewals. The DMV would like to run this query every time they need to contact all drivers that have an upcoming renewal in the next month.


### Execution Plan

The DBMS takes a SQL query and generates and **execution plan** for the database engine to follow

Takes a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM vehicles WHERE driver_id = 3
```

> Builds an execution plan
>
> Go through every row in the vehicles table
>
> Whenever the driver_id=3, copy the row
>
> ...and executes the plan

>#### QUIZ QUESTION
>On a joined select query that joins a vehicles table and a drivers table, the execution plan traverses the vehicles table and encounters a row with a driver_id that does not have a matching record in the foreign (drivers) table. If it is a/an ___ join query, then the execution plan would skip that row and not add it to the query's output.

## Client-Server Model

### Takeaways
Relational database systems follow a client server model.

#### Servers, Clients, Hosts
* In a Client-Server Model, a server serves many clients.
* Servers and clients are programs that run on hosts.
* Hosts are computers connected over a network (like the internet!)

#### Requests and Responses
* A client sends a request to the server
* The server's job is to fulfill the request with a response it sends back to the client.
* Requests and responses are served via a communication protocol, setting up expectations and rules behind how the communication occurs between servers and clients.

#### Relational Database Clients
* Can be CLIs (command line tools), GUIs or... a web server!
* The Postgres server is also known as Postgres

#### TCP/IP: Communication Protocol of the Internet
* Web apps also follow a client-server model over TCP/IP.

In our day to day web development flow, we'll need to interact with the database using a combination of clients, including our web server, as well as other clients.

## TCP/IP

### Takeaways
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.

TCP/IP uses:

* IP addresses: identifying the location of computers on the network
* Ports: describes where to receive traffic at a recipient computer, tied to a physical location on a computerâ€™s motherboard.
    * 80: HTTP
    * 5432: most database ports; default port for Postgres

>#### QUESTION 1 OF 7
>What is an IP Address?
>
>[ ] A computer process for identifying the location of a device on a network
>
>[x] A unique identifier for the location of a computer on the network

>#### QUESTION 2 OF 7
>What is a port?
>
>[ ] The location on your computer for connecting to a network
>
>[ ] The unique identifier of the computer on a network
>
>[ ] The specific traffic channel on a computer to send traffic down
>
>[x] The specific traffic channel on a computer to receive traffic

>#### QUESTION 3 OF 7
>What is the default port for most database interactions?
>
>[ ] 8080
>
>[ ] 80
>
>[x] 5432
>
>[ ] 5342
>
>[ ] 5243

>#### QUESTION 4 OF 7
>Why are IP addresses used? Check all the reasons that apply.
>
>[x] To locate a specific device out of millions of other devices on a network
>
>[x] To allow communications between devices over the internet
>
>[x] To notify the correct sender of the successful or failed receipt of information from the recipient
>
>[x] To send information to the correct recipient
>
>[x] To identify the host from other hosts on the network

>#### QUESTION 5 OF 7
>Why are ports used?
>
>[ ] Computers can be very complicated
>
>[ ] Ports expedite the sending of information
>
>[ ] Ports are a fallback location when IP addresses fail
>
>[x] A computer can receive multiple types of traffic at the same time, and ports allow them to be tracked and routed appropriately.
>
>
>
>> Correct! Ports allow multiple types of traffic being received at the same time on a given device, to be tracked and routed to where they need to go. Ports are much like the different terminals of an airport, tracking and receiving different airplanes at the same time, allowing for the effective receipt of multiple types of traffic at the same IP address.

>#### QUESTION 6 OF 7
>A/an ____ has many ____.
>
>[ ] port, IP addresses
>
>[x] IP address, ports
>
>
>
>>Correct! An IP address has many ports. In fact, there are a total of 65,535 TCP ports on a given computer -- ranging from number 0 to 65535 -- which means that a given computer is limited to a maximum of 65,535 unique simultaneous connections.
